### The Wercker Command Line Interface

The wercker command line interface (CLI) is a separate
[download](http://wercker.com/cli) and
allows you to develop, build and debug your applications locally.

It is available through the `wercker` command and running it will show the
commands available and what they do.

You can also get help for individual command by running `wercker help <COMMAND>`.
For instance, executing `wercker help build` will display usage
information and available flags for the `build` command.
