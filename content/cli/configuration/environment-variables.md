## Local environment variables

When running `wercker build` locally you can pass environment variables defined
on the host machine to the container. All environment variables that start with
`X_` will be made available in the container, with the `X_` prefix removed from
the key in the container.

In the following example an environment variable is defined before running
`wercker build`. This environment variable will be available as `$TOKEN` inside
the container:

```no-highlight
export X_TOKEN="secret"
wercker build
```

It is also possible to create a file that contains multiple environment
variables. You can specify the file to be used by adding the `--environment`
flag while running `wercker build` command:

```no-highlight
wercker --environment wercker.env build
```

The keys in the environment file also need to start with `X_`.
