## Pulling builds

You can use the
[wercker command line interface](/cli/usage/index.html)
to pull build artifacts, which are containers themselves, to your local machine.

There are two ways for pulling builds:

* by application (allowing you to get the latest build filtered by branch and/or result)
* by build-id

The wercker [web interface](/docs/web-interface/index.html) will show
how to pull a build for an application or a specific build. On the main
page for an application you can filter based on branch.

> Note that you need to add the [internal/store-container](/docs/steps/internal-steps.html#store-container) to your
**wercker.yml** for this to work.

Here are some examples of pulling a build by application:

```no-highlight
wercker pull <NAME>/<APPLICATION> --branch <BRANCH> --load
```

Or the last passed build:

```no-highlight
wercker pull <NAME>/<APPLICATION> --branch <BRANCH> --result passed --load
```

Pulling using a build-id is the shortest:

```no-highlight
wercker pull <BUILD-ID> --load
```

The `--load` option is not required, but will automatically load the container after the download.
A working Docker environment is required for this option.

The result of a wercker pull command looks something like:

```no-highlight
Fetching build information for application wercker/docs
Downloading Docker repository for build 558d2ecdff40819f0620ea15
Downloading: 100%
Download complete
Importing into Docker
Finished importing into Docker
```

The image should be visible when you run `docker images`:

```no-highlight
REPOSITORY                       TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
build-558d2ecdff40819f0620ea15   master              4eba85fb37af        37 minutes ago      611.2 MB
```

The repository for the container is named `build-<id>` and is tagged
with the branch name (the build-id is shown during the wercker pull).

You can now inspect the contents of the container by running:

```no-highlight
docker run -i -t build-558d2ecdff40819f0620ea15:master /bin/bash
```

### How pull works
Running this command will download the container as a `tarball`. After
the download finished, the wercker CLI can load the container into your Docker environment.

If you've already downloaded a `tarball`, you will get an error message that the `repository.tar` already exists. You must
either delete the file, or use the `-f` flag (`force`) and rerun the `wercker pull` command.

Check out the all available flags in the help page:

```no-highlight
wercker pull --help
```
