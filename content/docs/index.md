## Docs

Welcome to the wercker documentation! The *docs* section covers all the wercker
concepts and common tasks. If you are completely new to wercker, it's
recommended to first go through the [learn
section](http://devcenter.wercker.com/learn/basics/introduction.html).

If you want to get started right away, check out one of these quickstart guides
to start building in minutes:

* [Javascript](/quickstarts/building/javascript.html)
* [Python](/quickstarts/building/python.html)
* [Ruby](/quickstarts/building/ruby.html)

If you feel like something is missing
[open an issue](https://github.com/wercker/docs/issues) on GitHub. To the left
you see the table of contents, you can look through the list of subjects. You can
also search our docs on a specific subject.

We've open sourced the entire dev center on [GitHub](https://github.com/wercker/docs/).
Pull requests are much appreciated!
